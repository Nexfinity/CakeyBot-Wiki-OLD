### Overview

Cakey Bot is a highly customizable utility and moderation bot. You can configure many features and settings in Cakey Bot using our web dashboard. You can access our web dashboard by visiting [this link](https://cakeybot.app/dashboard/public) or by clicking "Manage Servers" in the navigation bar of our website. 

Once you have selected a server to manage you will be taken to that server's home page. This page will show you general server stats and some basic bot settings like the default music volume, language and command prefix. After you are on this page you can either modify these settings or navigate to other modules to configure.

### Toggle Modules

### View Logs/Warnings/Music Queue

There's several pages that contain read-only content for your server. These pages display various information such as moderation actions taken by members in your server, the current songs in the music queue and a list of all active warnings for users in the selected server.
