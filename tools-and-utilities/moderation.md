### Auto Moderation

If you are wanting Cakey Bot to automatically handle moderation you can check out [this section](auto-moderation.md) for more information.

### Warnings

You can warn users with a given reason using the `/warn <user> <reason>` . It will place a warning on their account which you can then view later with the `/warnings <username>`. Warnings will record the date the warning was received, the reason as well as the moderator who made the warning. Warnings will also automatically post to your [Audit Log](audit-log.md) if you have one set up for Cakey Bot. If you want to remove a specific warning from a user you can simply do `/unwarn <user> <warning ID>`.

### Muting

When you run the `/mute <user>` command, Cakey Bot will assign a mute role to that user preventing them from chatting/speaking in voice channels. Now, You might be asking "What role does Cakey Bot use for this?". This depends on a few factors:

1. If you have set a mute role in the web dashboard, Cakey Bot will use that role.
2. If you have not manually set a mute role, Cakey Bot will scan for any role with the name "Muted", if it finds one it will use that role.
3. If Cakey Bot does not find a "Muted" role, it will generate a brand new role with appropriate permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: In order for Cakey Bot to mute a user several things must happen. Cakey Bot must have **`Manage Roles`** permission and Cakey Bot's highest role must be higher than the Mute role and the muted user's highest role.
{% endhint %}

### Temporary Mutes

You can also mute people temporarily. It works exactly like normal muting above and requires the same setup/permissions but it will automatically remove the mute after the specified time. You can temporarily mute someone by using the `/tempmute <user> <time> <opt:reason>`command.

### Silent Actions

When you run most moderation commands on a user, they send a DM/Notification to the user via private messages. There are some instances where you may not want this capability. You can cancel sending a DM notification by adding `-s` or `-silent` anywhere in the "reason" section of the command.

For example: `/warn TestSubject -s Spamming the chat` will add a warning to the user but will not send a DM to them.

### Advanced Purge Filters

You can purge any amount of messages (up to 100) by typing `/purge <amount>`. This will delete the specified number of messages as long as they are not older than 2 weeks and are not pinned. 

You can also filter what types of messages you want to delete by typing `/purge <type> <amount>`. You can view a list of advanced filters below:

* Links (Any well-formatted URL/Link)
* Invites (Discord invite links)
* Images (Any messages that have an image/file attached)
* Mentions (Any messages that contain at least 1 user mention)
* Embeds (Any messages that contain an embed)
* Self (Any messages that were sent by Cakey Bot)
* Bots (Any messages that were sent by a bot)
* Components (Any messages that have buttons or selection dropdowns)
* User (Any messages that were sent by the specified user)
  * **Special Format:** `/purge user <user id>`
* Until (Deletes every message between the command and the specified message ID)
  * **Special Format:** `/purge until <message id>`
* Between (Deletes every message between the specified message IDs)
  * **Special Format:** `/purge between <message id> <message id>`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Sometimes Cakey Bot will purge fewer messages than the number you specify. This could be due to a few reasons:

* There are not enough messages that meet the specified filter
* Some messages may be older than 2 weeks within the specified amount
* Some messages may be "pinned" within the specified amount
