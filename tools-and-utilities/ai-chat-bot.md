# AI Chatbot

{% hint style="warning" %}
Cakey Bot's chat bot makes use of OpenAI's Davinci chat AI, meaning that every single message and response costs us money. As such, the AI chat bot can only be used by premium servers.

Be warned that these are all AI generated responses, as such they can possibly reply with inappropriate or unexpected messages. OpenAI has many measures in place to prevent this and Cakey Bot has a custom-built censoring filter for responses. However, some replies may slip past these safe-guards. By enabling the AI chat bot, you accept that you understand this.
