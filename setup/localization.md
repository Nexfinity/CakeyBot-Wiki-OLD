## Localization (Multi-Language)

{% hint style="info" %}
New translations are constantly being added to the bot. This means some strings/phrases may not be translated yet especially for features that have been added recently.
{% endhint %}

Cakey Bot (and our web dashboard) both support over 10 different languages. The language can be changed per-server and will apply for every user in that server. You can change the server's language from our web dashboard. Currently supported languages are listed below:

* English
* Dutch/Nederlands `(Vikthor)`
* German/Deutsch `(Marcel & MST2)`
* Korean/한국어 `(Johnmacro)`
* Japanese `(hikarun)`
* Greek/ελληνικά `(xxNikosGaming)`
* Swedish/Svenska `(Hampus)`
* Turkish/Türkçe `(Aleph & Oğuzhan)`
* Italian/Italiano `(GiorgioHerbie)`
* Arabic/العربية `(Sipancoolboy)`
* Romanian/Limba română `(Silviu200530)`

We are adding more languages and you can contribute via our Github Repository located [here](https://github.com/MrCakeSlayer/CakeyBot-translations) or on our Crowdin page [here](https://crowdin.com/project/cakey-bot). Once the majority of a language is completed (>80% translated) on Github/Crowdin it will be added as an officially supported language. Crowdin and Github are frequently synced so you can contribute to whichever you find the easiest.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you plan to contribute, please follow the rules and formatting guidelines provided in the [README ](https://github.com/MrCakeSlayer/CakeyBot-translations/blob/master/README.md)on the repository page.
