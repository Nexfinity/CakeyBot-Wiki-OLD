* Fixed error messages not showing on invalid server/guild users

#### Added

* Fully pushed caching for server settings on Cakey Bot. This means some changes on the web dashboard may take up to 5 minutes to apply in your server.
  * Some settings (like auto responder, custom commands, tags and auto moderation) will all still update live/instantly.

## Jan 9th - Silent Moderation QOL

#### Changed

* "-s" and "-silent" will be stripped from the reason
* "\[SILENT]" will be prefixed before the reason so that you know the action was done silently (without sending a DM to the user)

Remember, if you run the command in a public channel, some users may still see that you took the action, silent just prevents Cakey from sending a notice DM to the infracted user.
