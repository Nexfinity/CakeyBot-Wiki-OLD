## Overview

Cakey Bot is a highly customizable utility and moderation bot. You can configure many features and settings in Cakey Bot using our web dashboard. You can access our web dashboard by visiting [this link](https://cakeybot.app/dashboard/public) or by clicking "Manage Servers" in the navigation bar of our website.

Once you have selected a server to manage you will be taken to that server's home page. This page will show you general server stats and some basic bot settings like the default music volume, language, and command prefix. After you are on this page you can either modify these settings or navigate to other modules to configure.

## Login

You can login to our web dashboard by visiting [this link](https://cakeybot.app/dashboard/public). After you login you will be redirected to a list of servers that you are able to manage. If you attempt to open/manage a server that Cakey Bot is not in you will be directed to invite Cakey Bot. If Cakey Bot is in the server you will be redirected to the panel for that server.

## Manage/Customize

## Configure Modules

Most modules in Cakey bot have configuration settings that are specific to that module. They can change the behavior of how a module works or change who can use the features in the module. Each module that has additional settings will have its own page to easily separate and navigate its settings.

## View Logs/Warnings/Music Queue

There are several pages that contain read-only content for your server. These pages display various information such as moderation actions taken by members in your server, the current songs in the music queue and a list of all active warnings for users in the selected server.
